# Week 3

An amazing week for the third week! This week we will solve Binary Search and Linked List questions. Last week we tried implementing our own linked list, and on top of that, we implemented a stack. This week, we will see how to use the linked list we implemented and we will solve plenty of questions. Even though understanding Linked List may be difficult, once you grasp the logic, reasoning about questions becomes quite easy. Binary search, on the other hand, is fun. It's the first search algorithm taught in schools, and it might even be the most commonly used search algorithm :)
